As one of the most trusted consumer healthcare content providers in the United States, Coronago goes beyond content creation and conducts proactive surveillance for updates in the healthcare ecosystem. A team of healthcare professionals reviews our content accordingly, ensuring that existing and newly created content reflects the latest standard of care. Here’s how it works:
<ul class="ml-5">
	<li>Content reviews are prompted by new clinical guidelines, drug approvals or recalls, and major practice recommendations.</li>
	<li>The standards of care for some conditions, such as cancer and diabetes, change very quickly, so that content is reviewed more frequently.</li>
	<li>The Medical Affairs team ensures that existing and newly created content reflects the most accurate information.</li>
</ul>
We strive to be your most trusted ally in your pursuit of health and well-being.
